Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Goal 
Analyze the situation and recommend strategies for a successful transition to online video rental.

## Key Questions
*In this achievement we will explore the following:*

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

*Rockbuster Data Set - This dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis. The data set includes information on stores, staff, inventory, film categories, film names, film language, actors, customers, rental history, payment history, and addresses for stores, staff, and customers.*

## Tools
The data was analyzed using a relational database management system and PostgreSQL.

## Visualization
